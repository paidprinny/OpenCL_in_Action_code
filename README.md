OpenCL_in_Action_code
=====================

This repository will follow my learning in the book, "OpenCL in Action" and will contain (at a minimum) 
code examples from http://www.manning.com/scarpino2/ . It is my intention to extend these examples to do 
something slightly different wherever possible to demonstrate understanding and enjoy playing with the code, 
rather than just working out of a book.
